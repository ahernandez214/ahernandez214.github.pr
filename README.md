# Objective

- What is the key pain point?

The Data Analyst must organize data and develop a Power BI dashboard to improve workforce management, financial risk assessment, and project monitoring. The primary goal is to identify which projects and departments are over budget or underperforming. Data from multiple sources, including employee details, salary information, department budgets, and project details, must be structured correctly for reporting. The analyst will collaborate on building a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into employee performance, salary distribution, and project health. Additionally, the team wants to determine if department budgets, set on a two-year interval, can cover all expenses within a single year.


- What is the ideal solution?
The ideal solution is a Power BI dashboard that integrates financial and performance data to identify over-budget or underperforming projects. The dashboard should centralize and organize data, enable financial forecasting, and assess whether two-year budgets cover annual expenses. It will provide actionable insights for decision-making and improve budget monitoring and project management.
